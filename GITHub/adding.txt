git init (to initiale git adding procce)
git status(to check the file preence and status in folder /git)
git add . (to add all file in git repo)
git status(untraack file means it is present in your local repo) to solve it git add .
git status (unstrage means it is present in git but not online so make git commit ) git commit -m "message anyy for refrence "
git status(if nothing in master brance, its means know your file is add but you have to link it to online  )
